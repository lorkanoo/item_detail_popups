# Item detail popups
Item detail popups for Nexus (Guild Wars 2 addon manager).

## Features
- Get information from wikipedia about item description, notes, acquisition and more.
- Preview decorations from crafting window.
- Quickly check prices of items on the trading post.
- POE2-inspired, interactable popup system which allows browsing subsequent wiki pages for information.
- Designed for speed, with caching mechanisms to improve speed and reduce data usage.

## Roadmap
- more information from wiki,
- manually enter item name to search wiki for items that do not have chat links

## Disclaimer
This addon uses **macros** (virtual key-presses) to get item chat link from chatbox. Refer to [macro policy](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013762153-Policy-Macros-and-Macro-Use) for more details about macro usage.
